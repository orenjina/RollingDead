### Changes to spec
* Addition of tree stumps and berries on top of them
* Restriction to movement
* Berries are doubled in size

### Overall framework notes
* Probably DAMN, since there are only a limited amount of options now

### Basic behavior ideas
* Use vector calculation to keep supplying us with decision on which general action to perform with DAMN
* push berries off the stumps after calculating where the berry is exactly
