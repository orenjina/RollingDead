// Definitions: The most useful function for manipulating the arm is arm_set_rotation(ARM#, RADIAN#). 
  // ARM# can be from #1-#5
  // #1 controls the rotation of the bottom gear (allows the claw to swing from side to side, others are just up down)
  

// EXPLANATION: 

// The procedure I think is best goes as follows:
  // Drive up to the black block with berry on top
  // Decide if the berry is more to the right or more to the left. (if it is in center then either works)
  // Spin ARM1 to make claw point to opposite side of berry (but still face platform)
  // Then drop arm by making ARM2 as negative as possible
  // Then swing arm to the direction of berry to knock it off (setting ARM1)
  // Then for good measure, drop claw further by setting ARM3 more negative and make another pass by setting ARM1 again

// The timer and threshold I made are arbitrary
// Allow time between actions so that they dont interefere with eachother
int threshold = 20;
masterTime++;
printf("MasterTime:%i\n", masterTime);

if (masterTime == 10 + threshold)
{
  arm_set_sub_arm_rotation(ARM1, -0.8);
}
else if (masterTime == 2*threshold)
{
  arm_set_sub_arm_rotation(ARM2, -10);
  arm_set_sub_arm_rotation(ARM3, -0.6);
  arm_set_sub_arm_rotation(ARM4, 0.5);
}
else if (masterTime == 3*threshold)
{
  arm_set_sub_arm_rotation(ARM1, +2.9);
}
else if (masterTime == 4*threshold)
{
    //arm_set_sub_arm_rotation(ARM2, -1.5);
    arm_set_sub_arm_rotation(ARM3, -1.0);
   arm_set_sub_arm_rotation(ARM1, -2.7);
}
